### Characteristics of functional programming

1. Language features that aid functional programming - data immutability, first class functions, tail call optimization

2. Programming techniques used to write functional code - mapping, reducing, pipelining, recursing, currying and the use of higher order functions.

3. Advantageous properties of functional programming - parallelization, lazy evaluation and determinism.
